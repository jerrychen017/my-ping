# Cloudflare Internship Application: Systems

Hey recruiters,
I hope you are doing well in this pandemic. 
Here's my ping program.  

## How to run
- You need to have root access and `sudo` since I'm using SOCK_RAW. 
- You also need to have `en0` interface if you want to run `-IPV6`. 
- Makefile is included.
